**Computer Vision with PyTorch and FashionMNIST**

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook from the [Golem](https://github.com/KNSI-Golem) Level Up bootcamp (students science club) on computer vision using PyTorch and the FashionMNIST dataset. The notebook provides an introduction to computer vision and deep learning, with a focus on implementing and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch.

### Usage
To run the notebook, simply open it in Google Colaboratory and follow along with the provided code. You can also modify the code and experiment with different models and parameters to see how they affect the performance of the CNN.

### Additional resources
If you would like to learn more about computer vision, PyTorch, or deep learning, here are some useful resources:
